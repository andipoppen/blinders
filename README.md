# BLE controlled and motorized window blind

This project is a based on a [motorized window blind](https://www.instructables.com/id/Motorized-WiFi-IKEA-Roller-Blind/) that is using the IKEA Tupplur blind. 

The difference from the original is that this project uses BLE to control the window blind and the BLE module is built in the motor holder.
